# Smart AI Traffic Management System

Our cutting-edge solution employs AI and IoT to maximize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and enhance road safety. This system integrates intelligent traffic control, emergency vehicle priority, adaptive signal control, and automatic violation detection to create smarter and safer roads.

## Features

- **Dynamic Traffic Control**: Adaptive real-time adjustments to traffic signals based on vehicle density.
- **Emergency Vehicle Detection**: Automatically opens lanes for ambulances and other emergency vehicles.
- **Traffic Violation Detection**: Flags helmet and seatbelt violations, and detects overspeeding.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Automatically flags violators and issues fines.
- **Adaptive Signal Management**: Prioritizes high-traffic lanes while ensuring balanced flow.
- **Scalable & Future-Ready**: Extensible through smart city infrastructure for future-proof capabilities.
